                <div class="post-content">
                    <p>Being John Malkovich (1999) from the director Spike Jonze and the writer Charlie Kaufman tells us the story about a portal discovered by Craig Schwartz that allows people to watch and even control the life of a famous actor, John Malkovich. Schwartz, who lives with his animal-collecting wife Lotte, is passionate about puppetry but earns nothing from it. He falls in love with someone, Maxine from his new work but she does not share the same thoughts. The portal he discovers later on that somehow makes him someone else is like a saviour both on the way to Maxine and taking him away from his unexciting life. Identity, reality, and the pursuit of meaning in life are all topics covered in the film. Through characters and their experiences with the portal into John Malkovich’s mind, the movie questions themes such as what it is to fully be oneself, the limitations and intricacies of perception, and the human condition. </p>
                        <p>Being John Malkovich, a highly innovative film for its time, easily grabs the audience's attention with its chain of events. With all of its intellectual and aesthetic pleasures, it offers an unceasing thrill. One instance is when Malkovich enters the portal for fifteen minutes and finds himself in a realm where everyone is Malkovich and only uses the word "Malkovich." Viewers are now starting to ponder over this strangely complex meditation on awareness, identity, and reality. After the first time Craig enters the portal he tries to explain what he experienced and asks to Maxine, “The point is that this [the portal] is a very odd thing, supernatural, for lack of a better word. I mean, it raises all sorts of philosophical questions about the nature of self and the existence of soul. Am I me? Is Malkovich Malkovich?” I believe this quote is highly important and perfectly sums up the plot of the film. It asks the viewers, what does it mean to be me?</p>
                            <p>These confusions and questions are also effective on some other characters using the portal. Lotte Schwartz, Craig's wife, goes through a great change when she gets the chance to be Malkovich. She experiences what it is like to be a man and realizes she is at last feeling like herself. She tells Craig that she wants to change her sex and explains the reasons behind it but Craig finds it extremely ridiculous and defends it's just a phase. Lotte knows there is more to her situation than just being a phase and embraces it. Situations like this show us the portal's ability to change one's position within the symbolic order and its role in the construction of gender.</p>
                                <p>Being John Malkovich remains one of the most peculiar and surreal cinematic experiences ever. Through the viewpoint of being able to inhabit John Malkovich's body, it examines the ideas of manipulation, betrayal, and obsessive love. Transporting your consciousness to another person’s body is a theme that even today's cinema hesitates. Kaufman with the scenario he put forward was not only able to deal with this theme successfully but also achieved to go deep in many ways with the questions he asked the audience. While many of these questions can be answered within a logical framework, the line that I think is the main focus of the film questions a confusion and leads to each viewer's subjective evaluation of this masterpiece. What does it truly mean to be ourselves? Or, as Craig puts it, “Am I me?” </p>
