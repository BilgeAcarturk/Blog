                <h1 class="post-title">The Unconventional Structure of Thelma & Louise</h1>
                <div class="post-content">
                    <p>Thelma & Louise, a 1991 road movie directed by Ridley Scott and written by Callie Khouri, depicts the story of two female characters. Susan Sarandon and Geena Davis deliver an exceptional performance in their respective roles as Thelma, a married and unhappy woman constantly oppressed and living in fear of her husband, and Louise, a strong and independent character who has struggled with complicated relationships with men throughout her life. These close friends, both unhappy with their lives, decide to take a weekend trip together. A traumatic event at a bar they stop at changes their lives forever. The film's main theme is women's freedom, satirizing gender roles and emphasizing that women do not have to live according to the roles that men have assigned for them. In this way, Thelma & Louise challenges typical male-driven Hollywood movie clichés. </p>
                        <p>Thelma & Louise can be defended with the Bechdel test, which is a concrete proof in terms of breaking Hollywood stereotypes and with containing characters that are contrary to the lifestyles brought by patriarchal society understandings. The Bechdel test that I will talk about first has the characteristics of being a test that many cult films at the top of IMDB, which prepare an environment for Hollywood clichés, cannot pass. The test requires two named women to talk about topics other than men for a while. As we see from these films, female characters are generally written as dependent on men or are not important as men in the story. Thelma & Louise passes this test with the plot and dialogues created around the two leading female characters and their friendship, making it a timeless film. The rebellion against the typical Hollywood woman's lifestyle can also be understood from the main theme of the film. Thelma & Louise shows that women can travel together, create their own routes, and that their journey can be more important than male characters' journeys by changing the traditional elements of road movies. </p>
                            <p>We can analyse the ways that film resists patriarchal structures from many angles. While the male characters in the film may try to belittle or control the women, they do not go beyond being tools for character development for Thelma and Louise's stories. Thelma's husband, Darryl, who is one of the biggest oppressors of her true character and a major hindrance to the changes she wants to make in her life, is one of the reasons why she seeks freedom. However, once she breaks free from him, he becomes an observer of this woman and her story because our character who has stepped out of the clichés does not allow him to be more. Jimmy, compared to Darryl, is a more optimistic and understanding character. He is aware, like the other men who enter Louise's life, that he is an observer from the very beginning. He makes an effort to be more, but Louise, who has already drawn a strong and independent female portrait from the beginning, does not let him go beyond the limit in order to protect her drawn path. As I mentioned, the men remain observers and tools in this story.</p>
                                <p>Thelma & Louise received positive reviews from critics and audiences when it was released and was regarded as a feminist film. The film's cinematography, particularly the use of wide-angle shots for car scenes and landscapes, earned widespread praise for its innovation. Film, contrary to traditional Hollywood standards, explores gender roles and presents a courageous depiction of women who are not confined by the rules imposed upon them by men, but who instead have the power to open new doors in their lives. </p>
