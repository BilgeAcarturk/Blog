                <h1 class="post-title">Princess Mononoke and the Eternal Struggle</h1>
                <div class="post-content">
                    <p>For centuries our species has sought ways, chronologically, first for survival, then for continuity, and finally for development.
                        This search never promises absolute peace, and it had and will continue to eliminate all obstacles, even if it is generally to the detriment of other species, the environment, and even ourselves.
                        Contrary to what we see in most beliefs, the fact that it does not promise absolute peace is not related to the search for the new and its development, but to the attitude it shows in this way.
                        The exponential increase in this attitude and the way people protect their industries with violence has been the biggest obstacle in maintaining the balance between human and nature. </p>
                        <p>There is an ongoing communication between man and nature since the dawn of our species. As the forms and quality of this communication are constantly evolving, it can be mentioned that it is mostly a one-way profit-making exchange. 
                            We can see the mentioned gains in many ways in different lifestyles. Hunter and gatherer life, which is one of these forms, is a subsistence strategy seen in societies that gather wild plants and hunt animals. 
                            Most of them are nomadic societies in order to survive and ensure the continuity of the generation, as limited resources may be available when staying in a certain area. 
                            Due to basic needs such as nutrition, shelter and clothing, and because they are not prepared for what nature can bring in the first place, it can be said that there is a nature-dependent social structure and a one-sided shopping. 
                            Climate comes first among the unexpected conditions that may affect the lifestyle, and this effect is directly proportional to the addiction mentioned. 
                            According to P. B. De Menocal and C. Stringer (2016) in their research “Climate and the Peopling of the World” the main impact of climate on humans and hunter-gatherer societies is about where they live. 
                            Consider the example, as claimed by archaeological evidence, the vast Sahara has experienced a significant decline in population as a result of the decrease in monsoon rains. 
                            With such examples, we can see that in hunter-gatherer societies, the effect of nature on humans is much more apparent than what humans have on nature. </p>
                            <p>Communication in farmer lifestyles is healthier due to reduced one-way earnings. People are aware of their dependence on nature and are more optimistic towards it. 
                                Compared to the nomadic life, they are more prepared for unexpected conditions, and for this reason, the influence of nature on people is not as dominant as before. As it is not dominant, it still has many sides that make its presence felt. 
                                As Diamond (1999) mentioned in his book "To Farm or Not to Farm", nature can force people to migrate to which they are not accustomed due to weather conditions. 
                                Several times in many parts of the world, people have tried to collect crops from the opposite end of their country, while waiting for theirs to occur in their own region due to climate change. 
                                In these kind of environments, the peace that may be disturbed as a result of the attitudes we have mentioned may remain in balance for a long time.</p>
                                <p>In industrial societies, dependence on nature has decreased exponentially as we are now able to produce what nature provided us in the past. The industrial revolution brought unprecedented levels of innovation, production and growth. 
                                    As societies around the world urgently seek to rise to superpower status, the balance between humans and nature has suffered more than ever before. 
                                    'Development' within ourselves has caused polluted air, oil-filled waters and toxic dusts to be released into the air, water and soil. Over time, nature has become a huge waste that can be a solution and a response to the growing capitalist economy. 
                                    Considering these, it should not be forgotten that modernization is inevitable in a rapidly changing world. A society that wants to adapt and survive must learn to produce and take responsibility for what it brings.</p>
                                    <p>One of Hayao Miyazaki's best works, Princess Mononoke (1997), aims to persuade viewers that nature gives us so many possibilities, motives and also industrialisation is not the problem itself. We can see that as humans we are part of both the industrial and natural worlds. 
                                        Miyazaki says that, while talking about the message behind the movie, even living humbly can poison nature we destroy it by living in greed. He argues that nature is not only for humans but for all living, and in fact, it allows us to exist in a corner. 
                                        Miyazaki does not force the audience to choose a side and instead shows them the urgent need for balance in the world, harmony between man and nature. Even though forest spirits and gods may never be able to communicate with us in person, a balance between man and nature must still be kept.</p>
                                        <p>The loss of the harmony between man and nature is not a result of man's outlook on the future, but rather the inclusiveness of his actions and attitude. Over the centuries man's influence on nature and nature on man has evolved, and now our influence on nature is greater than it has ever had on us. 
                                            Even if modes of living or the dimensions of our communication with nature change, the balance between us must not be disturbed. Because we must be aware of one thing that if this balance is disturbed, it is us, not nature, that will gradually disappear.</p>
