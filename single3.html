                <h1 class="post-title">Depiction of Discriminated Youth</h1>
                <div class="post-content">
                    <p>La Haine is a 1995 French film directed by Mathieu Kassovitz that depicts the events of a day in the lives of three friends. The film explores issues such as police brutality, poverty, and racism through the lens of suburban life and young people. Via the characters of Vinz, Said, and Hubert, we witness three different perspectives. While the black-and-white shooting technique used in the film is used to reflect the atmosphere and increase the dramatic effect, the handheld camera technique used in the film enhances the realism of the events and draws the viewer into the story. While portraying society's prejudices and discriminations against the main characters, La Haine questions the reasons behind them. Therefore, I believe that the film challenges traditional clich√©s instead of approving them.  </p>
                        <p>The three different perspectives we see in the film, and the character developments portrayed, are important not only for the plot but also for what the film symbolizes. Although Hubert is aware that what is fair is not what is happening, he tries to stay on a more peaceful line for himself and his friends. In one of the events that I think had a great impact on the last scene, we see that Vinz escaped, and Hubert and Said were taken away by the police for no reason. The police officers attribute the banlieue youths they are prejudiced against as guilty without questioning them and try to intimidate them by applying both psychological and physical violence. Hubert's stance during this process has made him a symbol of both the resistance and resilience of young people and immigrants for me. I am of the opinion that the director is attempting to convey their own perspective and position in regards to these injustices. Rather than responding with violence or inequity, they are advocating for a more peaceful form of protest.</p>
                            <p>The film continues to critique the system while also discussing the inevitable consequences of some of the other personality types and behaviours that viewers can relate to beyond the perspective that I believe the film advocates, while also continuing to criticize the system. Said, like Vinz, struggles to control his anger, but like Hubert, he does not succumb to it. Among his two friends, I also believe they represent two opposing poles, while Said symbolizes another segment of society by remaining neutral in his reactions. Vinz, whose character development we see most profoundly, grows up in the film, like the other characters, exposed to poverty, discrimination, and police brutality. Due to his own sense of justice, he was more reactive to the injustices in his life than anyone else and was not afraid to express it. Throughout the film, we see Vinz and Hubert clash on many issues, but towards the end of the movie, Vinz has changed and learned to supress his anger. By the final scene, he has become a symbol of the discrimination and violence that he experienced. Vinz's death shows how serious and inescapable these problems are.</p>
                                <p>When La Haine was released in 1995, it received a lot of attention and quickly became a cult classic. The film was well received by critics and sparked controversy in many countries where it was released, just as it had in France. Kassovitz did not take a soft approach when depicting the harsh lives of these young people. The director aimed to show that these characters exist everywhere, that only their names change, and that discrimination is the only thing that remains constant.</p>
