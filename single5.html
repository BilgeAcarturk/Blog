                <h1 class="post-title">Mass Manipulation in Head-On</h1>
                <div class="post-content">
                    <p>The movie Head-On (2004) from the director Fatih Akin while telling us a story about a lonely man and an even more lonely woman who fight against their own weaknesses and what often seems like their own  best interests also draws attention of the audience to Turkish women living in Germany. It portrays how certain women, who live in a modern, capitalist nation but are surrounded by Turkish culture, must contend with Turkish traditions and identity crises. Male and female depictions and interactions demonstrate how gender roles are formed and how individuals are treated as a result. The dialogic interactions are implicit and not clear throughout most of the movie, but give us plenty of insight into the characterizations.</p>
                        <p>In Head-on, the patriarchal mentality we see divides women into two as wives and prostitutes. As we can see in the example of Sibel's mother, wives can never have the same privileges as their husbands and they never complain about it. They do not oppose their spouses and remain silent. The prostitutes, as they are called by other characters, are beings ready to please the man, and that is their sole purpose. They deserve to be humiliated in every manner possible. Naturally, this polarizing mind-set does not belong only to men. While talking to Selma, Sibel mentions that she is too young to get married seriously and asks: "Should i become a housewife?" She doesn't want to end up like her mother, but she knows that the family and culture she was born into wouldn't allow her to live the life she desires. She prefers to be the prostitute over being Cahit’s wife. She does not realize that the path she chose does not provide the freedom she was seeking until it was too late. Ultimately she cannot cross the borders of these two categories.</p>
                            <p>These limitations that culture brought are reflected not only in the compulsory preferences of women, but also in their desires. Selma has managed to be an exception to the distinctions I mentioned. Selma, whom Sibel admires in many ways at first, is a career-oriented woman who does not need a man's help and can live her life individually. Sibel, under the influence of the options and mentality imposed on her, moved away from this lifestyle which she saw as an example at the beginning. She has convinced herself that even being able to live without a man is a necessity and sees Selma's workaholism as a reason for her divorce. This mass manipulation is not effective only on Sibel, we see Selma ashamed about her being single during her conversation with Cahit. This has become a deficiency for her. Even though the women I have showed as an example try to escape from these conditions imposed on them, they also have developed an addiction which affects even their desires to it.</p>
                                <p>Akin made a severe but effective critique of the impact of unresolved or ignored taboos on women. The language used during the criticism increased the negativity of the audience's reaction to the attitude towards women in terms of sexuality and violence. He ensures us to witness the pressures that a woman sometimes avoids and sometimes chooses to face from her point of view, and in doing so, realism is at times so dominant that we cannot even continue to watch. Still, it is full of hope with the way that even souls against the wall can go on by learning from their wounds.</p>
